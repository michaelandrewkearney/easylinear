# easylinear
A LaTeX package to make your linear algebra class (just a little bit) easier

## Usage

The easiest way to use the package is to make a copy of the Overleaf project at [bit.ly/easylinear].

Read guide.pdf to see the command documentation.

The package is not on CTAN (yet?), so to use it locally you can get easylinear.sty from this repo and put it into the directory where your compiler finds local packages. Alternatively, put it directly into the directory with your .tex document. In either case, you can then import the package with `\usepackage{easylinear}`.
